Testing every core block ‚Äî and every variation of every block ‚Äî is no small task. That's why I built the Block Unit Test WordPress plugin. Deploy the Block Unit Test WordPress plugin and review every core Gutenberg block to ensure your theme fully supports Gutenberg.

## :question: Why is this a thing?

Coming soon.

## :movie_camera: Try Block Unit Test

See Block Unit Test at [WP Test Demo](https://demotest.abstractwp.com/block-unit-test/)

2. Download the plugin from the [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-unit-test/).
3. Activate the Block Unit Test plugin
