# Gutenberg Block Unit Test

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0%2B-red.svg)](https://github.com/richtabor/block-unit-test/blob/master/license.txt)

Testing every core block ‚Äî and every variation of every block ‚Äî is no small task. That's why I built the Block Unit Test WordPress plugin. Deploy the Block Unit Test WordPress plugin and review every core Gutenberg block to ensure your theme fully supports Gutenberg.

## Try Block Unit Test
See Block Unit Test at [WP Test Demo](https://demotest.abstractwp.com/block-unit-test/)
