The Block Unit Test WordPress plugin helps WordPress theme authors prepare for Gutenberg.

== Description ==

The Block Unit Test plugin is a development tool to help folks make better WordPress themes by preparing for the upcoming Gutenberg block editor.

If youâ€™re familiar with the WordPress Theme Unit Test, the Block Unit Test plugin is essentially same kind of test â€” but for core Gutenberg blocks. The plugin will create a single page with all the core blocks added, including mulitple variations of blocks.

Using the Block Unit Test plugin, WordPress theme authors can check the styling of each block and make the necessary fixes to fully support the new editor.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I start using Gutenberg? =
To get the full experience of the next-generation WordPress block editor,  you'll need a Gutenberg-ready WordPress theme, like [Tabor](https://themebeans.com/themes/tabor?utm_medium=block-unit-test&utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=tabor). Then install the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) WordPress plugin. That's it! ðŸ’¥

The new block editor is still very much in active development and is not recommended for production websites just yet.
